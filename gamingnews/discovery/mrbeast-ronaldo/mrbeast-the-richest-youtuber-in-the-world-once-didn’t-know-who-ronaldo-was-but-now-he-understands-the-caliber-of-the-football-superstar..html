            Now the richest YouTuber in the world knows who Cristiano Ronaldo is
          </p>
          <p>
            An interesting story has been shared by football fans all over social media. Not long ago, IShowSpeed met MrBeast, a YouTuber, and asked him if he knew who Cristiano Ronaldo was. MrBeast shared that he didn‚Äôt know who Cristiano Ronaldo was at all.
          </p>

          <p>Yet just a few months later, people jokingly remarked that since Cristiano Ronaldo launched his YouTube channel, MrBeast not only knows who Cristiano Ronaldo is, but he‚Äôs also worried that his record on the platform might be broken by the Portuguese superstar soon.</p>

          <p>The name MrBeast is likely familiar to many, especially those interested in the global YouTube community. MrBeast, whose real name is Jimmy Donaldson, holds the record for the most subscribers on YouTube, with 311 million at the time of writing. According to Forbes, in 2022, he earned $54 million a year, primarily from ads on his YouTube videos.</p>

          <p>However, on August 21, the global football superstar Ronaldo officially launched his personal YouTube channel. He broke the record for the fastest-growing channel on YouTube by reaching 20 million subscribers in just 24 hours. Currently, CR7‚Äôs channel has over 37 million subscribers, and this number is expected to grow rapidly.</p>
            
          <p>With the launch of his YouTube channel, Ronaldo quickly started raking in money, earning over $600.000 just after one day!</p>
